Today we are performing noise measurements again under various conditions.

The device under testing (DUT) is FIB3_W8_3! (U8_3 shorted !#$&*&@$#^)
The integration time is .2 * PLC => 200 Hz after a buffer of 1.5
The high resistance range is 5e8 to 1e10: 5e8,1e10
The low resistance range is 2.38e7 to 2.5e7: 2.38e7,2.5e7
The number of samples will be 40000 which lasts around 200 seconds

For today's experiment, two significant things have been changed. One, new probes were
used in the setup. They have been cleaned and should hopefully give better noise results.
Two, the lowest sensitivity index for retention have been raised to 9, 
corresponding to 1e-9 A/V, 200 Hz bandwidth. Our integration time of 3.33 ms is 
slightly lower than the min interval time of 5 ms, but hopefully that won't cause 
any problems.


After each dynamic scan, three sets of noise measurements will be made sequentially:
	1. One with LNA measurement bias set to -0.1 V.
	2. One with LNA measurement bias set to 0 V.
	3. One with the ground probe lifted from the pad.

Procedure:
	1. Do a target resistance sweep with the above settings.
	2. Change LNA bias to 0V, attach "noLNAbias" to device, click follow loop.
	3. Lifting the ground probe off the pad, attach "noGNDprobe", click follow loop
	4. Put down ground probe, change LNA bias back to -.1 V, and do 1.
